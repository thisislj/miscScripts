I recommend to download and install the driver from nvidia directly. Following steps are necessary:

    Download the latest linux driver for your card from Nvidia(http://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-uk)

store it in a folder, e.g. /tmp/NVIDIA###.run

Close all running programs and save all changes to any open documents!!!

    Switch to plain text console (CTRL + ALT + F1) and log in as normal user

    make the .run file executrable with:

    chmod +x /tmp/NVIDIA###.run

    stop the graphical window manager:

    sudo initctl stop gdm

    install the driver:

    /tmp/NVIDIA###.run

Follow the instructions - warnings might appear but usually can be considered harmless

    restart the graphical window manager:

    sudo initctl start gdm

    switch back to workspace by pressing CTRL + ALT + F7 or F8

(replaye NVIDIA### by the original filename of the file downloaded)s
